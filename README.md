This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I have been working through the practice and theory from Max's course on Udemy: [[[React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)]]

This is from Section 1 - 7. From there, I have worked on the `Burger builder` the project that we will build from scratch (using Create React App). Going through from the planning section all the way through to completion.
